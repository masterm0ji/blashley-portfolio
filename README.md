## Roaming Eyes
### Description
  This project shows shapes developed in css to look like an eye the follows the cursor when moved. 
### How to Run
  The program should run when the html file is opened. 

## Bus Tracker
### Description
  This project demonstrates the use of an API to create a map then add animation that follows the route from MIT to Harvard and back.
  
### How to Run
  In order to run this code you will need to implement your own API Key from google and put it in place of config.js is in the `<script src="config.js"></script>` line. To be secure I placed my API key in a config.js file then pushed it in a .gitignore so that it is not publicly accesible. 

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
  In this repository I hope to build upon the Pacmen exercise, add a game arena that looks similair to the game as well as some  ghost and dots. I've found a couple of tutorials online and think that I will play around with them until I can consistently get the code to work. i find that with my current PacMen code it sometimes does not work in the browser.

  For the Roaming Eyes project I want see what it would be like to add on eyes or add an opbject that moves around and make the eyes follow the object.

  For the bus tracker I want to make one for my local area.
